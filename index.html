      	<p>In the beginning, there was nothing. Then, around 13.7 billion years ago, the universe formed. We still don't know the exact conditions under which this happened, and whether there was a time before time. But using telescope observations and models of particle physics, researchers have been able to piece together a rough timeline of major events in the cosmos's life. Here we take a look at some of our universe's most important historical moments, from its infancy to its eventual death.</p>
      	<p>It all starts at the Big Bang, which "is a moment in time, not a point in space," Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology, told Live Science. Specifically, it's the moment when time itself began, the instant from which all subsequent instants have been counted. Despite its well-known moniker, the Big Bang wasn't really an explosion but rather a period when the universe was extremely hot and dense and space began to expand outward in all directions at once. Though the model of the Big Bang states that the universe was an infinitely small point of infinite density, that's just a hand-wavey way of saying that we don't quite know what was going on then. Mathematical infinities don't make sense in physics equations, so the Big Bang is really the point at which our current understanding of the universe breaks down.</p>
      	<p>The universe's next trick was to grow really big really fast. Within the first 0.0000000000000000000000000000001 (that’s a decimal point with 30 zeros before the 1) seconds after the Big Bang, the cosmos could have expanded exponentially in size, driving apart areas of the universe that had previously been in close contact. This era, known as inflation, remains hypothetical, but cosmologists like the idea because it explains why far-flung regions of space appear so similar to one another, despite being separated by vast distances. Back in 2014, a team thought they had found a signal of this expansion in light from the early universe. But the results later turned out to be something much more mundane: interfering interstellar dust</p>
      	<p>A few milliseconds after the beginning of time, the early universe was really hot — we're talking between 7 trillion and 10 trillion degrees Fahrenheit (4 trillion and 6 trillion degrees Celsius) hot. At such temperatures, elementary particles called quarks, which are normally bound tightly inside of protons and neutrons, wandered around freely. Gluons, which carry a fundamental force known as the strong force, were mixed in with these quarks in a soupy primordial fluid that permeated the cosmos. Researchers have managed to create similar conditions in particle accelerators on Earth. But the difficult-to-achieve state only ever lasted a few fractions of a second, in terrestrial atom smashers as well as in the early universe.

			<p>This year, Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to launch the first private space mission into orbit with no professional astronauts. Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who chartered the trip and will command the mission, will spend two to four days orbiting Earth in the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, alongside three other people.

			While Crew Dragon’s short mission is unlikely to have much of an effect on the health of the passengers, these capsules will soon be going on much longer trips, which could have a large effect on a person’s health. Space missions decrease astronauts’ bone density by 1%-1.5% per month and weaken movement and postural muscles. Even the heart gets smaller, as it doesn’t have to pump against gravity in space. When these changes take place can vary a lot depending on what exercises are done and how often. But if no exercise is done, these changes will start from 14 days. This is why professional astronauts use exercise equipment in space to keep their muscles strong.

			But capsular spacecraft, such as Crew Dragon and Nasa’s Orion – which will take people to the Moon and Mars – will not have the space for large exercise equipment, so passengers will be limited in what they can do. It’s uncertain what effect this may have on the average person’s physical health during space flight, which is what Northumbria’s Aerospace Medicine Systematic Review Group is helping answer.</p>
